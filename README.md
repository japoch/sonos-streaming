This guide goes through all the steps to stream music from an analog vinyl player (or any other RCA source) to your Sonos system, by using a Raspberry Pi.

The guide is based on this Instructable guide: https://www.instructables.com/Add-Aux-to-Sonos-Using-Raspberry-Pi/. But I've spent time simplifying the process, wrapping everything in a `docker-compose.yml` and creating a pre-built Raspberry Pi image where everything is set up using a `systemd` service.

## Needed hardware
To stream the sound from a vinyl record player to the Sonos speakers, you will need:

* 1x RaspberryPi (with USB Type-A)
* 1x RaspberryPi power adapter (adjusted to the RaspberryPi you're using)
* 1x 8GB MicroSD card
* 1x SD card reader/adapter (if your computer doesn't already support it)
* 1x Behringer U-PHONE UFO202
* 1x ART USB Phono Plus PS (optional)

## Overview software

### Darkice

DarkIce is a live audio streamer. It records audio from an audio interface (e.g. sound card), 
encodes it and sends it to a streaming server. This software is used to read the vinyl signals 
coming from the U-PHONE UFO202.

### Icecast2

Icecast is a streaming media server which we will use to stream the live audio from Darkice and 
broadcast it out in our local network. This is what the Sonos speakers will pick up and play.

The Icecast2 web GUI is avalable at http://HOSTNAME:8000/ with username 'admin' and password 'hackme'.

## How to stream vinyl to your Sonos speakers

> **Note**
> This section uses my pre-built Raspberry Pi image. If you wish to use the default Raspberry Pi image and set up the service yourself, that is also possible. This can be done by flashing the SD card with the default RPi image, clone down this repository on the RPi, `cd` into the repo, install docker by executing `install-docker.sh` and setting up the service by running `setup-service.sh`.

### Download the pre-built Raspberry Pi image

Start by downloading the pre-built Raspberry Pi image here: [https://github.com/maxvfischer/sonos-streaming/suites/17721720018/artifacts/1014666374](https://github.com/maxvfischer/sonos-streaming/suites/17721720018/artifacts/1014666374)

This image was built using `pi-gen`, by executing `build-pi-image.sh` inside a GitHub Action pipeline ([https://github.com/maxvfischer/sonos-streaming/actions/runs/6682008698/job/18156701236](https://github.com/maxvfischer/sonos-streaming/actions/runs/6682008698/job/18156701236)).

The image will automatically start the `systemd` service `sonos-streaming` on boot up, starting the streaming by executing `docker-compose.yml`.

### Unzip the Raspberry Pi image

As both `pi-gen` and `GitHub Actions` apply compression, you will need to decompress it twice until you have the raw image file `image_2023-10-29-sonos-streaming.img`.

### Install Raspberry Pi Installer

The Raspberry Pi Installer is a software developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to simplify the installation of the Raspberry Pi OS to a microSD card.

Download the Raspberry Pi Installer on your computer by following the instructions on this website: [https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

After you've downloaded, installed and started the installer, you should see a page similar to this:

![installer_1](./images/installer_1.png)


### Install the Raspberry Pi image to the SD card

Start of by inserting the microSD card you're planing to use into the computer.

![installer_4](./images/installer_4.png)

![installer_3](./images/installer_3.png)

Then click on `CHOOSE OS` and choose `Use custom` at the very bottom. Look for and choose the downloaded Raspberry Pi image.

![installer_2](./images/installer_2.png)

After that, click on `CHOOSE STORAGE` and choose the microSD card you just inserted.

![installer_5](./images/installer_5.png)

Before installing the OS, we want to change some configurations. This is done by clicking on the cogwheel in the lower right corner.

![installer_6](./images/installer_6.png)

Do the following:

* Check `Enable SSH` and `Use password authentication`.
* Check `Set username and password` and choose whatever username and password you want to use to log into the Raspberry Pi.
* Check `Configure wireless LAN` and **fill in the name of the wifi your Sonos speakers are connected to, as well as the wifi password** (this is very important, if done incorrectly, the speakers won't find the music stream).

Then click `SAVE`.

![installer_7](./images/installer_7.png)

![installer_7_1](./images/installer_7_1.png)


To install the OS to the microSD card, click `WRITE`. You might get prompted with a warning saying that all existing data will be erasted. If you're fine with this and want to proceed installing the OS, click `YES`.

![installer_8](./images/installer_8.png)

The installation should take approx. 5-10 minutes.

![installer_9](./images/installer_9.png)

When the installation is done, remove the microSD card from your computer and insert it into the Raspberry Pi.

![installer_10](./images/installer_10.png)


### Connect vinyl player to the Raspberry Pi

Start of by connecting the USB from Behringer U-PHONE UFO202 to the Raspberry Pi.

![installer_11](./images/installer_11.png)

Then connect the red and white RCA cable from the vinyl player to the equivalent **input** on the Behringer U-PHONE UFO202. Red to input red, white to input white.

![installer_12](./images/installer_12.png)

Finally, connect the power cable to the Raspberry Pi.

![installer_13](./images/installer_13.png)


### Point the Sonos speakers to the vinyl stream

Make sure that you have the Sonos app installer on your phone. It can be found in the App store. Also make sure that your Sonos system is properly set up and that you can control your speakers from your app.

Sorry about the language in the upcoming images. I wasn't able to change the language in my app from Swedish to English.

Open the Sonos app and click on the `Music` icon in the botton navigation bar. Then Click `Add a Service`, scroll down and click on `TuneIn` (not `TunIn (New)`, but the old one). Then follow the instructions to add `TunIn` to your app.

![installer_14](./images/installer_14.png)

![installer_15](./images/installer_15.png)


When added correctly, `TunIn` should show up under your Services. Click on it, then click on `My radio stations`

![installer_16](./images/installer_16.png)

![installer_17](./images/installer_17.png)

Click on the three dots in the top right corner, then on `Add a new radio station`.

![installer_18](./images/installer_18.png)

![installer_19](./images/installer_19.png)

Fill in the following in the prompt:

* Streaming-URL: http://kodi-3.fritz.box:8000/phono.mp3
* Station name: Phono

![installer_20](./images/installer_20.png)

Your vinal streaming station should now show up under `My radio stations`. You can now click on the `Vinyl` station, check the speakers you want to play the music from, put on a vinyl on your record player and enjoy.
